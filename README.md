Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Means Clustering. Logistic Regression, used for binary classification (injury or no injury), achieved a 95% accuracy, but may be influenced by class imbalance. Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, also achieved 95% accuracy, providing robustness and handling complex relationships between features. K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, was used to explore patterns in collision data by grouping incidents into clusters based on injury counts and other factors. To further improve predictive performance, addressing the class imbalance in injury data is recommended.
